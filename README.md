# Cybersecurity-Homelab
I built a multi-platform cybersecurity homelab to mimic real-world enterprise setups, allowing me to practice skills in penetration testing, network defense, and Active Directory management. This homelab is a project I'm passionate about, as it helps me grow in both Offensive and Defensive Security.
